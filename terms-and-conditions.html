      <h1>Terms and Conditions</h1>
      <p>
        Welcome to Car Sharing Supreme (the "Company", "we", "our", or "us"). By
        using our website, mobile application, and/or any other related services
        (collectively, the "Service"), you agree to be bound by the following
        terms and conditions (the "Terms and Conditions" or "Agreement").
      </p>
      <h2>General</h2>
      <p>
        This Agreement sets forth the general terms and conditions of your use
        of the Service and the products and services made available through the
        Service, and is in addition to any specific terms and conditions that
        may apply to specific products and services. We reserve the right to
        change the terms and conditions of this Agreement at any time, and such
        changes will be effective immediately upon posting on the Service. We
        encourage you to review this Agreement whenever you access the Service.
      </p>
      <h2>Use of Service</h2>
      <p>
        The Service is available only to individuals who are at least 18 years
        old. By using the Service, you represent and warrant that you are at
        least 18 years old. You may not use the Service for any illegal or
        unauthorized purpose. You must not, in the use of the Service, violate
        any laws in your jurisdiction (including but not limited to copyright or
        trademark laws).
      </p>
      <h2>Privacy</h2>
      <p>
        We respect your privacy and the use and protection of your personal
        information. Please review our Privacy Policy to understand our
        practices.
      </p>
      <h2>Payment</h2>
      <p>
        Certain products and services made available through the Service may
        require payment. If you elect to make a payment, you agree to pay all
        fees and charges associated with your use of the Service (including any
        applicable taxes). We reserve the right to change our fees and charges
        at any time, and we will provide you with advance notice of these
        changes. All payments must be made using a valid payment method. You are
        responsible for the timely payment of all fees and for providing us with
        a valid payment method for payment of all fees. If your payment method
        fails or your account is past due, we may collect fees owed using other
        collection mechanisms. This may include charging other payment methods
        on file with us, retaining collection agencies, and legal action.

      <p>
        This Agreement and your use of the Service shall be governed by and
        construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California,
        without giving effect to any principles of conflicts of law. You agree
        that any action at law or in equity arising out of or relating to this
        Agreement shall be filed only in the state and federal courts located in
        San Francisco County, California, and you hereby consent and submit to

      <h2>Waiver</h2>

        and the Company and governs your use of the Service, superseding any
        prior agreements between you and the Company (including, but not limited
