    <h1 class="display-5">Terms and Conditions</h1>
    <p>Welcome to Car Sharing Supreme (the "Company", "we", "our", or "us"). By using our website, mobile application,
        and/or any other related services (collectively, the "Service"), you agree to be bound by the following terms
        and conditions (the "Terms and Conditions" or "Agreement").</p>
    <h2>General</h2>
    <p>This Agreement sets forth the general terms and conditions of your use of the Service and the products and
        services made available through the Service, and is in addition to any specific terms and conditions that may
        apply to specific products and services. We reserve the right to change the terms and conditions of this
        Agreement at any time, and such changes will be effective immediately upon posting on the Service. We encourage
        you to review this Agreement whenever you access the Service.</p>
    <h2>Use of Service</h2>
    <p>The Service is available only to individuals who are at least 18 years old. By using the Service, you represent
        and warrant that you are at least 18 years old. You may not use the Service for any illegal or unauthorized
        purpose. You must not, in the use of the Service, violate any laws in your jurisdiction (including but not
        limited to copyright or trademark laws).</p>
    <h2>Privacy</h2>
    <p>We respect your privacy and the use and protection of your personal information. Please review our Privacy Policy
        to understand our practices.</p>
    <h2>Payment</h2>
    <p>Certain products and services made available through the Service may require payment. If you elect to make a
        payment, you agree to pay all fees and charges associated with your use of the Service (including any applicable
        taxes). We reserve the right to change our fees and charges at any time, and we will provide you with advance
        notice of these changes. All payments must be made using a valid payment method. You are responsible for the
        timely payment of all fees and for providing us with a valid payment method for payment of all fees. If your
        payment method fails or your account is past due, we may collect fees owed using other collection mechanisms.
        This may include charging other payment methods on file with us, retaining collection agencies, and legal
        action.</p>
    <h2>Content</h2>
    <p>All content on the Service, including but not limited to text, graphics, images, and software, is the property of
        the Company or its licensors and is protected by copyright and other intellectual property laws. You may not use
        any content on the Service for any commercial purpose without the express written consent of the Company.</p>
    <h2>Trademarks</h2>
    <p>The Company and all related logos, product and service names, and design marks are trademarks of the Company or
        its licensors. You may not use these marks without the prior written consent of the Company. All other
        trademarks and service marks are the property of their respective owners.</p>
    <h2>Disclaimers</h2>
    <p>The Service is provided on an "as is" and "as available" basis. The Company makes no representations or
        warranties of any kind, express or implied, as to the operation of the Service or the information, content,
        materials, or products included on the Service. The Company will not be liable for any damages of any kind
        arising from the use of the Service, including but not limited to direct, indirect, incidental, punitive, and
        consequential damages.</p>
    <h2>Limitation of Liability</h2>

        limited to direct, indirect, incidental, punitive, and consequential damages. The Company will not be liable for
        any damages resulting from loss of use, data, or profits, or from any unauthorized access to or alteration of
        your transmissions or data.</p>
    <h2>Indemnification</h2>
    <p>You agree to indemnify and hold the Company, its affiliates, officers, agents, and employees, harmless from any
        claim or demand, including reasonable attorneys' fees, made by any third party due to or arising out of your use
        of the Service, your violation of this Agreement, or your violation of any rights of another.</p>
    <h2>Governing Law</h2>
    <p>This Agreement and your use of the Service shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the
        State of California, without giving effect to any principles of conflicts of law. You agree that any action at
        law or in equity arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall be filed only in the state and federal
        courts located in San Francisco County, California, and you hereby consent and submit to the personal
        jurisdiction of such courts for the purposes of litigating any such action.</p>
    <h2>Severability</h2>
    <p>If any provision of this Agreement is found to be invalid or unenforceable, that provision shall be enforced to
        the maximum extent possible, and the remaining provisions shall remain in full force and effect.</p>
    <h2>Waiver</h2>
    <p>The failure of the Company to exercise or enforce any right or provision of this Agreement shall not constitute a
        waiver of such right or provision. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between you and the Company
        and governs your use of the Service, superseding any prior agreements between you and the Company (including,
        but not limited to, any prior versions of this Agreement).</p>
